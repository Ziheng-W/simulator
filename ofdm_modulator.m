function ofdm_waveform = ofdm_modulator(symbol_stream, subcarriers, cp_length)

% You may assume the number of symbols is a multiple of the number of
% subcarriers. Please implement an OFDM modulator based on IDFT, as
% detailed in Section 11.2-5 in Digital Communications 5th edition.

% Input: 
% Symbol_stream: N complex-valued symbols, 
% subcarriers: the number of subcarriers,
% cp_length: the length of CP

% Output: ofdm_waveform is of length equal to 2 * N real-valued symbols + CP * N / #subcarriers
